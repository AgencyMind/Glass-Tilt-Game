# Glass Tilt Game

## Escape the algorithm. Rediscover the web.

Glass Tilt Game puts serendipity back into your Lens browsing experience. In a world where algorithms decide what you see, this extension introduces controlled chaos to help you stumble upon content you'd never encounter otherwise.

## Why Glass Tilt?

Ever notice how your feeds show you the same types of content over and over? Glass Tilt Game breaks that pattern. With a simple click of the ðŸŽ² button, you're transported to unexpected corners of the Lens ecosystem.

It's not random, but it's not predictable either. Like tilting a pinball machine just enough to influence the ball without controlling it completely, Glass Tilt gives you subtle influence over your content journey without predicting what you "should" see.

## Features

- **One-click exploration** - Instantly jump to fresh content with a single click
- **No algorithms watching you** - Discover content without being profiled or tracked
- **Subtle influence** - Your preferences gently tilt the odds, but never determine outcomes
- **Break free from filter bubbles** - See perspectives and creators you'd miss otherwise

## Get Started

Install the extension, visit Hey.xyz, and look for the ðŸŽ² button in the corner. Click it to begin your journey.

Each click is a roll of the dice, slightly weighted in your favor. Where will you end up next?
